A semiconductor is a material whose electrical conductivity lies between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like rubber). The most widely used semiconductor is silicon, though germanium and gallium arsenide are also common.
In semiconductors, the flow of current depends on the movement of charge carriers—electrons and holes. At absolute zero, a pure semiconductor behaves like an insulator because no free charge carriers are present. However, as temperature increases, some electrons gain energy and jump from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind holes. This creates a limited but controllable flow of current.
To enhance conductivity, semiconductors are doped with small amounts of impurities. Adding a pentavalent impurity (like phosphorus) produces an n-type semiconductor with extra electrons as majority carriers. Adding a trivalent impurity (like boron) produces a p-type semiconductor, where holes dominate.
The junction of p-type and n-type materials forms a p–n junction, the basis of diodes, transistors, solar cells, and integrated circuits. By controlling electron and hole movement, semiconductors enable switching, amplification, and energy conversion.
Thus, semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics, powering everything from computers and smartphones to LEDs and microchips.

A diodeis an electronic component that allows current to flow in only one direction, acting like a one-way valve. It is made from a **p–n junction**, where p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined. When the diode is forward biased (positive voltage applied to the p-side), electrons and holes cross the junction, allowing current to flow.
In reverse bias (positive voltage to the n-side), the junction blocks current, except for a very small leakage. 
This property makes diodes useful for **rectification** (converting AC to DC), voltage regulation, signal demodulation, and protection circuits. Special types include **LEDs** (light-emitting diodes), **Zener diodes** (for voltage regulation), and **photodiodes** (for light detection). Diodes are fundamental in modern electronics.
