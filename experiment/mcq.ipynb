    "text=\"A semiconductor is a material whose electrical conductivity lies between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like rubber). The most widely used semiconductor is silicon, though germanium and gallium arsenide are also common.In semiconductors, the flow of current depends on the movement of charge carriers—electrons and holes. At absolute zero, a pure semiconductor behaves like an insulator because no free charge carriers are present. However, as temperature increases, some electrons gain energy and jump from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind holes. This creates a limited but controllable flow of current.To enhance conductivity, semiconductors are doped with small amounts of impurities. Adding a pentavalent impurity (like phosphorus) produces an n-type semiconductor with extra electrons as majority carriers. Adding a trivalent impurity (like boron) produces a p-type semiconductor, where holes dominate.The junction of p-type and n-type materials forms a p–n junction, the basis of diodes, transistors, solar cells, and integrated circuits. By controlling electron and hole movement, semiconductors enable switching, amplification, and energy conversion.Thus, semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics, powering everything from computers and smartphones to LEDs and microchips.\""
